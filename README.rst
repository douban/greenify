installing from github
----------------------

To install the latest development version:

  pip install git+git://github.com/douban/greenify.git#egg=greenify

getting started
---------------

make MySQL-Python compatible with gevent_.

1. make virtualenv
  mkvirtualenv test

2. install libgreenify
  cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV .

3. install greenify
  export LIBGREENIFY_PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV

  pip install git+git://github.com/douban/greenify.git#egg=greenify

4. modify mysql-connector-c_ manually, or get it from https://github.com/CMGS/mysql-connector-c

5. install mysql_connector-c_ like:
  cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' -D GREENIFY_INCLUDE_DIR='$VIRTUAL_ENV_INCLUDE' -D GREENIFY_LIB_DIR='$VIRTUAL_ENV_LIB' -D WITH_GREENIFY=1 -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='$VIRTUAL_ENV'

6. modify MySQL-Python_ manually, or get it from https://github.com/CMGS/MySQL-python. Let setup.py know where is mysql-connector-c_ which was modified. I'm not sure the new-version branch is working good or not.

7. in your app, active greenify_ before initiate environment:
   import greenify
   greenify.greenify()

8. enjoy the new world.

be careful
----------

because gevent_ will make your app run like **multi-thread**, so you must care about the thread safe. I suggest using pooling for manage connections. In our program we use pool_ which is 'split from SQLALchemy_'.
